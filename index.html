        <h2>About Me</h2>
          
          <p>I graduated from Berklee College of Music in 2010 as a vocal principle with a Bachelor of Music Business Management degree. Singing, playing guitar, and writing songs are just a few of my many passions. After graduation, I moved to New York City where I worked in the music industry for several years. Life in New York City was hectic and I decided I wanted to make a change. I had always loved Nashville and so I got on a plane and headed south, with my guitar over my shoulder.
          </p> 
        
          <p>When I moved to Nashville I did not have much of a plan, I played in various writers rounds, and got a job at a local restaurant as a host to pay the bills. I eventually ended up doing nearly every job at that restaurant, minus cooking the food. It is there that I discovered a passion for hospitality, food, and beverage. I embarked on the arduous task of becoming a sommelier, which I am still in the process of doing after completing the introductory level. I eventually got a job as a server at a fine dining restaurant in Nashville, something I loved doing until the COVID-19 pandemic in which I was furloughed from my job. The hospitality industry isnâ€™t for everyone but those who love it tend to thrive in chaotic situations and enjoy dealing with a multitude of people and personalities. I would say this statement rings true for me both personally and professionally.</p> 

          <p>I am currently enrolled in a coding and web development boot camp offered by Trilogy Education through a partnership with Vanderbilt University. The program is a full-stack web development program. After the program, I will be proficient in basic coding, algorithms, data structure, JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Java. I would like to become a web developer because I see the many applications that web development has. As a person with many passions, I am interested in incorporating all of my interests and applying them to a career in web development.
