## **Description**

For this project I created my very own website to house my web portfolio. I created three separate HTML files. One for my bio, portfolio, and contact form. I created a corresponding CSS style sheet to add some styling. For this project I used a combination of bootstrap components, javascript, HTML, and CSS styling to develop the elements of my responsive portfolio. My goal was to have a responsive layout.

## **Technology Stack**
